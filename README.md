<h1>WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE </h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
I recently completed a tutorial on Workplace Etiquette that focused on professional behavior, communication, and teamwork in the office environment.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
My objective was to understand the importance of proper workplace conduct and learn how to interact respectfully and effectively with colleagues, supervisors, and clients.

<br>
Action:
Through the tutorial, I explored different scenarios involving workplace professionalism, punctuality, and respect for diversity. I learned about dress codes, maintaining confidentiality, and demonstrating positive work ethics. I also practiced how to handle workplace conflicts calmly and appropriately.
<br />

<br>
Result:
By the end of the tutorial, I had a clear understanding of how to conduct myself professionally in any work setting. I became more aware of how small actions—like being punctual, respectful, and considerate—can impact my reputation and relationships at work. I now feel prepared to maintain professionalism and contribute positively to any team or organization.
